- It would be nice to have cascading effects when deleting/updating a movie or a person. 
So that all other tables that reference a deleted tuple, also would be deleted (or default to null)

- sorting movies based on genre would have been interesting. Because "genre_filmed" is a table that describes a direct 1-to-1 relationship.
Currently there is only 1 table describing relationships and that is "worked_on". 
"worked_on" might seem a bit bloated since it references so many other table keys. (such as person_id, profession_id, film_id)

- improvements/optimizations to the database queries. they are far from perfect and can be jarring to read. 
Refining it over time might be worthwhile in terms of learning best practice.

- Database access interfaces might seem inconsistent. Sometimes my implementations seem to dictate the interfaces and thats not good.

- in terms of gui javafx is kinda nice because im used to it. But its not an industry standard 
so im gonna move on to something a bit more relevant in industry.

- it would be interesting to further develop this project with networking features. (maybe once the sql queries have been optimized)
